Great! Now that the site is deployed, here's how to set up your custom domain www.bullwyze.com:

    First, log into your domain registrar where bullwyze.com is registered

    Add these DNS records:

    Type  Name  Value
    CNAME www   helpful-eclair-49fe16.netlify.app

    In your Netlify dashboard:
        Go to "Domain settings"
        Click "Add custom domain"
        Enter "www.bullwyze.com"
        Follow the verification steps

The DNS changes may take up to 48 hours to propagate, though it often happens much faster.

Would you like me to help with any specific part of this process?


After the deployment is complete, you'll need to:

    Purchase the domain www.bullwyze.com from a domain registrar (like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains) if you haven't already.

    Configure your DNS settings at your domain registrar:
        Add a CNAME record pointing www.bullwyze.com to your Netlify URL
        Add an A record for the apex domain (bullwyze.com) pointing to Netlify's load balancer IPs:
            75.2.60.5
            99.83.190.57
            75.2.70.75
            99.83.179.108

    In your Netlify dashboard:
        Go to Domain Settings
        Add your custom domain (www.bullwyze.com)
        Enable HTTPS (Netlify provides free SSL certificates through Let's Encrypt)
