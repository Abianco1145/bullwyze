# Database Backup Storage Guidelines

1. Estimate required storage:
   - Calculate the size of your current database
   - Estimate daily growth rate
   - Plan for at least 30 days of daily backups

2. Choose appropriate storage solution:
   - Local storage: Ensure RAID configuration for redundancy
   - Cloud storage: Consider services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage

3. Implement backup rotation:
   - Keep daily backups for the last 7 days
   - Keep weekly backups for the last 4 weeks
   - Keep monthly backups for the last 12 months

4. Monitor storage usage:
   - Set up alerts for when storage capacity reaches 80%
   - Regularly review and clean up old backups

5. Test backup restoration:
   - Perform monthly test restorations to ensure backup integrity

6. Encrypt backups:
   - Use strong encryption for all backup files
   - Securely store encryption keys separate from backups

7. Implement off-site backups:
   - Store copies of backups in a geographically separate location

8. Document backup and restoration procedures:
   - Create detailed documentation for the backup process
   - Include step-by-step restoration instructions
